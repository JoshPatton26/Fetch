In this assignment I was asked to read the input from a .csv file containing a list of transactions from the user point system. I was 
asked to write a program that took two arguments 1) the amounts of points to spend, 2) the name of the .csv file. I chose to write 
this project entirely in C. I developed this program on VSCode with Msys2 gcc as the compiler, while using WSL to compile and run the code. 

For testing purposes please make sure you are using Msys2 gcc as the compiler, clang might work but I have not tested. And make sure 
that you are running the code in a WSL environment for best results. To compile the code you will use the command 
'gcc fetch.c -o fetch', and to run the code use 
'./fetch <num of points to spend> <name of .csv file>' Eg. './fetch 500 transactions.csv.' 
All the code compiled and ran with no errors or warnings on my local computer.
